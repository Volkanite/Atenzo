# Torque-Atenza
Extended Pids for the Mazda Atenza to be used in Torque Pro

- The [Torque Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque) app from the Google Play store is required, this functionality does not exist in the free version.
- Download the atenza.txt file and rename it to atenza.csv
- Place the CSV file in the .Torque\extendedPids folder on the Android device. This folder is hidden, it might be in the root of the phone storage, or it might be in the root of the SD card depending on how the app is installed or configured
- Once the file is in the proper location, open up Torque Pro, go into Settings, go to the Manage Extra PIDs area, click the "three dots" icon in the upper right corner, choose Add Predefined Set, and select atenza from the list.
